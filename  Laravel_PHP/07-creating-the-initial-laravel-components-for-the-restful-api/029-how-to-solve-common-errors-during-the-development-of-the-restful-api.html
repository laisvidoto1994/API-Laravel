            <p>It is natural that during the course you face problems with the operation of your project, maybe you get an error, while during the class everything went well. For this type of situations, I invite you to verify the original course code in the public repository of the course, here.</p>







<p>There, you can look class by class, the code that is being done in each one. The title of each commit sent to the repository matches the title of the classes.</p>



<p>If you enter the list of commits, you can find from the most recent to the oldest each of the commit of the course. Each commit coincides with the title and the code developer during a class. Of course, there are a lot of commits, so you can do a search to get to the state of the project in a particular class.</p>

<p>It is important that you check the state of the code in the exact moment of that class (and not the latest status) because throughout the course the same file can suffer many different changes that have nothing to do with the class you are watching. Let's see how to get the state of the code at a given time.</p>







<p><br>Let's imagine that you have problems with your code in the class titled "Implementing The Index Method for UserController".</p>

<p>So you go to the top right and input the title of the class you want:</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><br></p>







<p>Once you have the results, be sure to clic the Commits tab, to see the code for that specific class:</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><br></p>

<p><br></p>







<figure></figure>







<p><br></p>







<p>Then clic on the corresponding result and there you will get the details of the code in that specific moment of the class.</p>







<figure></figure>







<p><br></p>







<p>In that class only one file was changed. If you check below, there are the details about the files changed. The red lines are lines that were removed, and the green are lines that were created/edited.</p>

<p><br></p>







<p>Now, you have two optciones.</p>







<p>If you want to see the status of the whole project on that class (all the structure), you just need to click "Broswe files".</p>







<figure></figure>

<p><br></p>







<p><br></p>







<p>In the other hand, if you want to see the status of the specific files modified in that class, sou you can just click on view, in the right side of the file you want to check (if there are several files changed).</p><figure></figure><p><br></p>















<p><br></p>







<p>Once there, you can see the full code of that file like if you wre traveling in the time, exactly in the moment of that class</p>







<p><br></p><figure></figure><p><br></p><p>Now you know a very effective way to get access to the status of the code in a specific moment.</p><p>This will allow you to compare the codes and find the differences or event copy and paste to do not do it by your self.</p><p>Of course, if after check the code, compare, copy and paste all the relevant files, you still having problems, you can add a new question or contact me directly</p><p><br></p><p>See you in the next class :)</p>
